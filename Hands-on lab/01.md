## Exercise 1: Discover and assess the on-premises environment

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will use Azure Migrate: Server Assessment to assess the on-premises environment. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

### Task 1: Create the Azure Migrate project and add assessment and migration tools

In this task, you will create the Azure Migrate project and select the assessment and migration tools.

> **Note**: In this lab, you will use the Microsoft-provided assessment and migration tools within Azure Migrate. A number of third-party tools are also integrated with Azure Migrate for both assessment and migration. You may wish to spend some time exploring these third-party options outside of this lab.

1. Click on **Azure portal** shortcut in the desktop and log in with below Azure subscription credentials.

    * Azure Usename/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

    > **Note**:  The Azure Migrate appliance needs access to the Internet to upload data to Azure. It also needs access to the Hyper-V host. However, it does not need direct access to the application VMs running on the Hyper-V host. To protect the application environment, the Azure Migrate Appliance should be deployed to a separate subnet within Hyper-V, rather than in the same subnet as your application. 
    >
    > The Hyper-V environment has a NAT network using the IP address space 192.168.0.0/16. The internal NAT switch used by the SmartHotel application uses the subnet 192.168.0.0/24, and each VM in the application has been assigned a static IP address from this subnet.
    >
    > The Azure Migrate Appliance will be connected to a separate subnet 192.168.1.0/24, which has been set up for you. Using the 'Azure Migrate Switch' connects the appliance to this subnet. The appliance is assigned an IP address from this subnet using a DHCP service running on the SmartHotelHost.

#### Task summary 

In this task you created and configured an Azure Migrate migration assessment.

### Task 5: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, and select **Servers**. Under **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** select **Groups**, then select the **SmartHotel VMs** group to see the group details. Note that each VM has their **Dependencies** status as **Requires agent installation**. Select **Requires agent installation** for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel VMs group. Each VM has dependency status 'Requires agent installation'.](images/Exercise1/requires-agent-installation.png)

2. On the **Dependencies** blade, select **Configure OMS workspace**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade, with the 'Configure OMS Workspace' button highlighted.](images/Exercise1/configure-oms-link.png)

3. Create a new OMS workspace. Use **AzureMigrateWSSUFFFIX** as the workspace name, Choose a workspace location close to your lab deployment, then select **Configure**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Configure OMS workspace' blade.](images/31.png)

4. Wait for the workspace to be deployed. Once it is deployed, navigate to it and select **Advanced settings** under **Settings** on the left and then select **Connected Sources** from *Advanced settings* blade and click **Agents management**. Make a note of the **Workspace ID** and **Primary Key** (for example by using Notepad).

    ![Screenshot from Hyper-V manager highlighting the 'Connect' button for the smarthotelweb1 VM.](images/Exercise1/connect-web1.png)

7. Select **Connect** again when prompted and log in to the **Administrator** account using the password **demo!pass123**.

8. Open **Internet Explorer**, and paste the link to the portal into the address bar. You may be prompted to sign in again. Choose the 64 bit download link and run the installer. 

    > **Note**: If Internet Explorer does not load the site properly you may need to turn of the **Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration** on **Server Manager** under **Local Server** and install Chrome on the VM to navigate to the link. 

    ![Screenshot showing the Internet Explorer prompt to run the installer for the Microsoft Monitoring Agent.](images/Exercise1/mma-win-run.png)

9. Select through the installation wizard until you get to the **Agent Setup Options** page. From there, select **Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS)** and select **Next**. Enter your Workspace ID and Workspace Key that were copied earlier on the next page, and select **Azure Commercial** from the Azure Cloud drop-down. Select through the remaining pages and install the agent.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent install wizard, showing the Log Analytics (OMS) workspace ID and key.](images/Exercise1/mma-wizard.png)

10. Paste the following link to the Dependency Agent Windows installer into the browser address bar. **Run** the installer and select through the install wizard to complete the installation.

    ```
    https://aka.ms/dependencyagentwindows
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing the Internet Explorer prompt to run the installer for the Dependency Agent.](images/Exercise1/da-win-run.png)

11. Close the virtual machine connection window for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.  Connect to the **smarthotelweb2** VM and repeat the installation process (steps 8-10) for both agents (the administrator password is the same as for smarthotelweb1) and close the Hyper

    You will now deploy the Linux versions of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on the UbuntuWAF VM. To do so, you will first connect to the UbuntuWAF remotely using an SSH session to the IP address of the SmartHotelHost. The SmartHotelHost has been pre-configured with a NAT rule which forwards SSH connections to the UbuntuWAF VM.

12. Open a command prompt using the desktop shortcut.  

    > **Note**: The SmartHotelHost runs Windows Server 2019 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled. This allows the command prompt to be used as an SSH client.

13. Enter the following command to connect to the **UbuntuWAF** VM running in Hyper-V on the SmartHotelHost:

    ```bash
    ssh demouser@192.168.0.8
    ```

14. Enter 'yes' when prompted whether to connect. Use the password **demo!pass123**.

    ![Screenshot showing the command prompt with an SSH session to UbuntuWAF.](images/Exercise1/ssh.png)

15. Enter the following command, followed by the password **demo!pass123** when prompted:

    ```s
    sudo -s
    ```

    This gives the terminal session elevated privileges.

16. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> and \<Workspace Key\> with the values copied previously. Answer **<Yes>** when prompted to restart services during package upgrades without asking. 

    ```s
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <Workspace ID> -s <Workspace Key>
    ```

17. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> with the value copied earlier:

    ```s
    /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart <Workspace ID>
    ```

18. Enter the following command. This downloads a script that will install the Dependency Agent.

    ```s
    wget --content-disposition https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux -O InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
    ```

19. Install the dependency agent by running the script download in the previous step.

    ```s
    sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -s
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing that the Dependency Agent install on Linux was successful.](images/Exercise1/da-linux-done.png)

20. The agent installation is now complete. Next, you need to generate some traffic on the SmartHotel application so the dependency visualization has some data to work with. Browse to the public IP address of the SmartHotelHost, and spend a few minutes refreshing the page and checking guests in and out.

#### Task summary 

In this task you configured the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature, by creating a Log Analytics workspace and deploying the Azure Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on both Windows and Linux on-premises machines.

### Task 6: Explore dependency visualization

In this task, you will explore the dependency visualization feature of Azure Migrate. This feature uses data gathered by the dependency agent you installed in Task 5.

1. Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate **SmartHotel VMs** VM group blade. The 3 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as 'Installed'. (If not, refresh the page **using the browser refresh button**, not the refresh button in the blade.)

    ![Screenshot showing the dependency agent installed on each VM in the Azure Migrate VM group.](images/Exercise1/dependency-viz-installed.png)

2. Select **View dependencies**.

    ![Screenshot showing the view dependencies button in the Azure Migrate VM group blade.](images/Exercise1/view-dependencies.png)

3. Take a few minutes to explore the dependencies view. Expand each server to show the processes running on that server. Select a process to see process information. See which connections each server makes.

    ![Screenshot showing the dependencies view in Azure Migrate.](images/Exercise1/dependencies.png)
